# Getting Started with GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is an amazing free service that lets you host static websites directly from your GitHub repository. Whether you're creating a personal portfolio, project documentation, or a blog, GitHub Pages makes it incredibly easy to get your content online.

## What is GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.

## Setting Up Your First Site

### Step 1: Create a Repository

Create a new repository named `username.github.io` where `username` is your GitHub username.

### Step 2: Choose Your Approach

You have several options:
- Use Jekyll (recommended)
- Upload HTML files directly
- Use a static site generator

### Step 3: Configure Jekyll

Create a `_config.yml` file in your repository root:

```yaml
title: Your Site Title
description: A brief description of your site
theme: minima
```

### Step 4: Create Content

Start with an `index.md` file:

```markdown
---
layout: home
---

# Welcome to My Site

This is my first GitHub Pages site!
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Keep it simple** - Start with basic markdown files
2. **Use themes** - Jekyll themes can save you time
3. **Test locally** - Set up Jekyll locally for development
4. **Custom domains** - You can use your own domain name

## Conclusion

GitHub Pages is perfect for developers who want a simple, version-controlled way to publish content. Give it a try for your next project!
